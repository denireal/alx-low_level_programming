# 0x08-Recursion Tasks
## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim and emacs
* All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pendantic -std=gnu89`
* All files ends with a new line
* The README.md file at the root of the folder of the project. The README.md file also contains the description of all 0x08-recursion tasks
* Betty coding style was used
* The codes use betty style
* Global variables were not used
* All function prototypes are contained in the main.h file
* Standard library functions were not used, for example: printf, puts, etc.
* [_putchar] was used in this project. see 'https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c'
* Static variables and loops were not used
## Repo
* Github repository: alx-low_level_programming
* Directory: 0x08-recursion
## Description
### Tasks Description and all [*.c] files
#0. A C function that prints a string, followed by a new line: [0-puts_recursion.c]
#1. A C function that prints a string in reverse: [1-print_rev_recursion.c]
#2. A C function that returns the length of a string: [2-strlen_recursion.c]
#3. A C function that returns the factorial of a given number: [3-factorial.c]
#4. A C function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`: [4-pow_recursion.c]
#5. A C function that returns the natural square root of a number: [5-sqrt_recursion.c]
#6. A C function that returns `1` if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return `0`: [6-is_prime_number.c]
#7. A C function that returns `1` if a string is a palindrome and `0` if not: [100-is_palindrome.c]
#8. A C function that compares two strings and returns `1` if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return `0`: [101-wildcmp.c]
